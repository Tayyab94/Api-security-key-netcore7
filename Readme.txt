## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to your project, explaining its purpose and the core features it offers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List the prerequisites users need to have before using your API. For example:

- .NET Core SDK (version X.X or higher)
- Any additional dependencies or prerequisites

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git


Build the project:
dotnet build

Run the project:
dotnet run

Your API should now be up and running.
API Key Authentication

Protect your API with API key authentication. This section explains how to obtain and use an API key.
Obtaining an API Key

    Contact the project maintainers to request an API key. They will provide you with a unique key for authentication.

Using the API Key

To authenticate your requests, include the API key in the X-API-Key header of your HTTP requests. For example, using cURL:

curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" https://your-api.com/endpoint


If you're using a different tool or language to make requests, refer to its documentation on setting custom headers.
Endpoints

List the available endpoints in your API and provide a brief description of what each endpoint does.

    Endpoint 1: Describe what this endpoint does.
    Endpoint 2: Describe what this endpoint does.
    ...

Middleware and Action Filter

Explain the middleware and action filter features in your API.

    Middleware for API Key Validation: The middleware checks incoming requests to ensure they contain a valid API key. Requests without a valid key are rejected.

    Action Filter for Fine-Grained Control: Use the action filter to restrict access to specific APIs or endpoints. Apply the action filter to the respective controller or action method in your code.
